In this project, I examined the use of gene-driven strategies with linked genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The first section of the project involved examining the evolution of literature linked to Autism. In depth analysis was performed to extract relevant papers. The second section implemented data analysis techniques to learn more about the linked genes. Lastly, I performed basic network analysis to identify clusters of genes and used web tools such as, PantherDB and STRING, to gain further insight into the functions of the clustered genes.
